Basic information for setting up the course.

course.yaml -- This includes data for the splash page, including the blurb,
  when the course starts, intro video or image, etc.

course_template.yaml -- Contains navigation and other content for all
 courses within an appengine application.  I think this means that
 all courses would have the same logo.

assets/img -- contains images and logos:
  logo.png -- Logo used in header and nav-header
